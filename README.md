# Custom Co-op Ghosts
## Stay fashionable with your friends while dead!

It can get pretty confusing when you're dead with other friends, resulting in unwanted confusion on who's who while dealing what pitiful damage you can. With this mod, that issue is no more!

37 custom sprites in total to cover every ghost! Some characters have been given some special attention to detail such as The Lost, Tainted Forgotten, and Tainted Eden. Isaac is the same though, because what else did you expect?

Additionally, there's modded character support! Included in the mod folder is a README file that'll teach you how, which you can find by doing the following:
Steam Library > Right-click Isaac > Manage > Browse Local Files > mods > custom_coop_ghosts

### Pre-created Modded Character Sprites

Sodom + Gomorrah weren't included as their anm2 files are constantly overridden, which removes the ghost sprites.
JoJo characters weren't included because I hate spriting hair.
Tarnished characters weren't included because I'd rather go insane before doing another full set of characters with even wackier sprites.
